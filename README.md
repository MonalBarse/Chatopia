# Chatopia

## - A real-time text chat platform

## Overview

Welcome to Chatopia â€“ a project designed for me to learn the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This application serves as a practical learning experience, allowing me to delve into the world of real-time chat applications while mastering the core technologies of the MERN stack.

- Also, if you want to follow how I approached building this from scratch, you can check out [Learnings](./Learnings.md) file. I tend to update this every time I make any progress.

## Features

- **Account Creation:** Users can create accounts to personalize their chat experience.
- **Chat Rooms:** Join different chat rooms for diverse conversations.
- **Real-time Messaging:** Utilizes web sockets for instant communication.
- **Data Storage:** MongoDB is employed for efficient and scalable data storage.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Built with React.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface. And utilizing React's Context API for state management.
- **Backend:** Developed using Node.js and Express.js to handle server-side logic.
- **Database:** MongoDB serves as the database for storing user accounts and chat data.
- **Websockets:** Enables real-time communication for a seamless chatting experience.
